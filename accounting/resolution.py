"""Settlement — resolved from Polymarket's own outcome data.

Two rules:

1. **Never infer a winner from price or ``closed``.** A BTC close above the
   strike is a good guess at the outcome, not the outcome. Likewise, a closed
   book whose outcome prices happen to be 1/0 is not explicit resolution
   evidence. The market resolves through Polymarket's oracle flow and can
   disagree with Binance (different snapshot instant, different source). A
   ledger that settles on a guess produces PnL that looks precise and is
   wrong, which is worse than PnL that says PENDING.

2. **Map by the `outcomes` field, never by index.** `clobTokenIds[0]` is not
   guaranteed to be Up. Assuming it silently inverts every trade
   (finding H5). If the labels are unrecognised this returns UNKNOWN rather
   than picking one.
